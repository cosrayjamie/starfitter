These scripts are used to remove unmatched stars.

Run ./step1.sh

This will create a file called csvs.txt

Look in the file. It will contain a list of .csv files that had unmatched stars. 

If it is empty then either all stars were matched or you need to redo the processing (i.e. ./reset.sh)

If there were .csv files with unmatched stars continue on to run ./step2.sh

./step2.sh will create the file ./step3.sh

Look at ./step3.sh and verify that it makes sense. If all looks good, run it.

./step3.sh

And finally,

./step4.sh

Now you should run ./reset.sh in the main starfitter directory to restart the star processing.
